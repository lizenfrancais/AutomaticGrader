# AutomaticGrader
Automatically and consistently grade Integrated Performance Assessments

It can be hard to ensure that you are scoring consistently even when using a rubric.
The Integrated Performance Assessment Automatic Grader helps to solve that problem.

Simply collect basic information about a student's performance on either Interpersonal Speaking or Presentational Writing.
Enter the information into the program and let the computer do the rest of the work for you.

No more doubling back to make sure you gave students with similar samples the same results.
Increase your confidence that you are scoring consistently throughout the course.

This program is designed to work with the rubrics created by Clover School District for Levels 1 and 2.
Rubrics were created with AAPPL subdivisions in mind.
